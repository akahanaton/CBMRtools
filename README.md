=========

Repository for scripts and tools/pipelines developed by CBM members
The repository is tentatively organized as follows:
* tools/ is dedicated to self-contained 'pipelines' or 'packages' (e.g., RNAseq_pipeline) possibly using multiple scripts and languages.
* scripts/ is divided by programming languages (R/ py/ perl/ etc.), each containing single scripts of general use (e.g., an R script to plot heatmaps). Each subdir should contain a template file (e.g., R/template.R, py/template.py) with the general format that should be adopted for each script in that language.
